# Progressor (INCOMPLETE)
Progressor aims to generalize progress displays.

## Description
When performing long running operations, it's nice to let your users know how things are coming along.  For example, they might want to see something like

	Processing... 44%

as you convert bahjillions of something in to that other thing.  Progressor aims to create a consistent, reusable API for creating such displays.
